### 1. Artichoke extract (Enginar Özü)
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
Artichokes are super rich in antioxidants, which improve skin health and appearance and slow down skin aging. They are also rich in vitamin C, which is one of the biggest contributors to healthy collagen development and artichokes aid detoxification. The antioxidants in artichokes also prevent oxidative stress, which affects skin health. The leaf extract also contains another important chemical called cynaropicrin, which reduces the damage caused by UV rays and protects the skin. For the treatment of fat, artichoke is a naturally diuretic plant. Indeed, it promotes the renal elimination of water and the drainage of water retained in the tissues. Thus, the artichoke is excellent to fight against the cellulite.

### 2. Arbutin
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
Arbutin is a widely used skin lightening agent derived from hydroquinone. It is all-natural and can be extracted from bearberry, cranberry, blueberry, and pears. Arbutin's power in reducing hyperpigmentation has been proven and confirmed by various studies over the years. A 2018 study published in Cosmetic Facial Surgery found that arbutin effectively reduced melanin content to approximately 39%. Aside from skin lightening, arbutin also has antioxidant properties that improve skin texture. It's also used in anti-aging products because of this characteristics.

### 3. Acetyl Glutamine
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
It is non-essential and conditionally essential amino acid, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. In blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid. Glutamine helps skin cells function optimally for smooth, radiant, healthy-looking skin. Furthermore, Glutamine is scientifically proven to play an important role in the growth of fibroblast cells. Collagen is the protein that gives skin its youthful firmness, and it makes up 75% of our skin. As we age, the amount of collagen that we naturally produce begins to decline, and therefore, the breakdown of collagen and exposure of skin to damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun leads to the formation of wrinkles and sagging skin. Glutamine helps to reverse these effects of aging by significantly increasing collagen production within the skin – reversing the effects of aging, restoring skin's natural tone, and smoothing out the texture. Acetyl glutamine is an improved form of glutamine

### 4. Acetyl Hexapeptide-37
**Kaynak:** Sentetik

**Açıklama:**
Hexapeptide that enhances aquaporin 3 (AQP3) expression, improving the water flux from the basal layer of the epidermis to the stratum corneum. Skin hydration is not only preserved but raised with this hexapeptide. Furthermore, it improves the barrier function and increases collagen I synthesis and keratinocyte proliferation, providing a complete treatment against skin aging. Skin not only protects us against the environment but regulates water exchange. Water is essential for the normal functioning of the skin, especially for the stratum corneum (SC) and skin barrier properties. Mechanisms that control water transport are not fully understood, but there is a continuous exchange of water between the SC, the living cells in the underlying epidermis and the atmosphere. Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins involved in water transport through the different tissue layers, acting as water selective pores. AQP3 is the most abundant aquaglyceroporin in the human epidermis, facilitating the transport of water, glycerol and other small solutes. Therefore, AQP3 improves transepidermal permeability, increasing water content in the skin surface and helping the barrier function. This peptide enhances AQP3 expression levels in keratinocytes, which are inherently reduced due to chronologic aging and photoaging. In addition, this peptide presents further properties that contribute to maintaining skin barrier integrity and a youthful appearance.

### 5. Retinol (Vitamin A)
**Kaynak:** Sentetik

**Açıklama:**
Regulates the processes of differentiation, proliferation and intercellular communication. When it get into a cell, it can make a bond with nuclear sensors. Thus, sections of the cell genome are activated or decelerated. Retinol provides minimal skin damage, a brief recovery period and a low probability of complications. Retinol can effectively cleanse the skin, has anti-inflammatory effects, makes skin glow, improves skin texture and structure, and provides a lifting effect.

### 6. Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
Niacinamide (nicotinamide) comprises one of the two forms of Vitamin B3; niacin (or nicotinic acid) being the other, both of which provide equivalent vitamin activity. As an essential component of living cells, Vitamin B3 is essential for protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Niacinamide is a precursor in the synthesis of the pyridine coenzymes NAD and NADP involved in cell metabolism, and as such play a key role in the production of energy. Key attributes: Upregulates Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) (in vitro), Enhances skin tone (in vitro), Helps improve the overall appearance of skin, Improving skin texture, Evening skin complexion, May help to reduce the appearance of acne, May help to revitalize hair to minimize hair fall and improve its overall appearance

### 7. Panthenol (Vitamin B5)
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
DL-Panthenol is the provitamin of DL-Pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5), which plays a key role in the human intermediary metabolism. Deficiency of Vitamin B5 can result in many dermatological disorders. DL-Panthenol is applied in almost all types of cosmetic preparations. It cares hair, skin and nails. It acts as a skin conditioning agent to provide deep penetrating moisture to the skin, stimulating epithelisation to provide wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects. It also functions as a hair conditioning agent to provide long lasting moisture to hair, preventing damage, thicken hair and improve luster and sheen. This product can also be used in nail care products to improve hydration and impart flexibility.

### 8. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid)
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
Vitamin C is a very effective anti-oxidant that neutralizes free radicals – the unstable molecules that age the skin as a result of pollution, smoking and exposure to the sun. It inhibits melanin, stimulates growth of the hydro-lipid film and enhances collagen synthesis, an important skin protein that strengthens the structural support and elasticity of the skin.

### 9. Vitamin E (Tocopherol)
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
Tocopherol is a form of Vitamin E typically derived from vegetable oils. Tocopherol is known as an antioxidant superhero that provides protection for skin. (This shouldn't be terribly surprising, since tocopherols make up 96% of skin's natural antioxidant defence system!). Studies show tocopherol: Absorbs UV rays and helps prevent UV-induced free radical damage to skin. Acts as an anti-inflammatory agent in skin. Helps moisturise. Helps reduce pollution-related free radical damage. There's also preliminary evidence that it can help prevent scarring and reduce the signs of aging, too.

### 10. Zinc (Çinko)
**Kaynak:** Doğal

**Açıklama:**
Zinc is crucial for helping to heal wounds and boost immunity, and it also supports a healthy blood supply. Zinc also supports sleep quality and recovery after hard workouts, and it improves your body's ability to use calories you've consumed for fuel rather than shuttling them to storage as fat. Zinc plays three main roles in your body, all of which are crucial to muscle growth and development. Zinc accelerates muscle building chemical reactions, stabilizes protein structures and regulates your hormone levels. Functions like these help the muscle protein synthesis process that kicks in after a resistance training workout. Zinc is involved in hair growth and keeps the oil glands around the hair shaft working properly. Zinc plays an important role in hair tissue growth and repair. It also helps keep the oil glands around the follicles working properly. Zinc is also believed to play a crucial role in DNA and RNA production. This is required for the normal division of hair follicle cells, leading to healthier hair growth. Zinc also may help keep hormone levels balanced, which could be one of the reasons why it is so effective in preventing hair loss.
