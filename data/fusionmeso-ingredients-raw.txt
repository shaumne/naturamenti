İÇERİK: Acetyl Glutamine
KAYNAK: natural

AÇIKLAMA:
It is non-essential and conditionally essential amino acid, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body’s demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. In blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid. Glutamine helps skin cells function optimally for smooth, radiant, healthy-looking skin. Furthermore, Glutamine is scientifically proven to play an important role in the growth of fibroblast cells. Collagen is the protein that gives skin its youthful firmness, and it makes up 75% of our skin. As we age, the amount of collagen that we naturally produce begins to decline, and therefore, the breakdown of collagen and exposure of skin to damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun leads to the formation of wrinkles and sagging skin. Glutamine helps to reverse these effects of aging by significantly increasing collagen production within the skin – reversing the effects of aging, restoring skin’s natural tone, and smoothing out the texture. Acetyl glutamine is an improved form of glutamine

Hexapeptide that enhances aquaporin 3 (AQP3) expression, improving the water flux from the basal layer of the epidermis to the stratum corneum. Skin hydration is not only preserved but raised with this hexapeptide. Furthermore, it improves the barrier function and increases collagen I synthesis and keratinocyte proliferation, providing a complete treatment against skin aging. Skin not only protects us against the environment but regulates water exchange. Water is essential for the normal functioning of the skin, especially for the stratum corneum (SC) and skin barrier properties. Mechanisms that control water transport are not fully understood, but there is a continuous exchange of water between the SC, the living cells in the underlying epidermis and the atmosphere. Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins involved in water transport through the different tissue layers, acting as water selective pores. AQP3 is the most abundant aquaglyceroporin in the human epidermis, facilitating the transport of water, glycerol and other small solutes. Therefore, AQP3 improves transepidermal permeability, increasing water content in the skin surface and helping the barrier function. This peptide enhances AQP3 expression levels in keratinocytes, which are inherently reduced due to chronologic aging and photoaging. In addition, this peptide presents further properties that contribute to maintaining skin barrier integrity and a youthful appearance.

AÇIKLAMA:
Hexapeptide that increases fatty tissue volume in specific areas improving facial appearance and providing attractive body curves. This peptide stimulates peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression, enhancing adipogenesis rate. This leads to a higher lipid accumulation and volume growth in the desired areas like lips. When aging, skin gets thinner, loses firmness and gravity pulls it downwards leading to undesired and visible changes in the face and body. Furthermore, adipose tissue, which is mostly found beneath the skin and acting as a supporting tissue, gets redistributed and decreases in areas like cheeks, facial oval, breasts or lips. Nowadays, the relevance of perfect lips make people look for efficient and non-aggressive ways of increasing tissue volume. PGC-1α is a transcriptional coactivator that, interacting with the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor PPARγ, modulates adipogenesis rate. This peptide increases local volume improving facial appearance, by promoting PGC-1α expression and lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue.

KAYNAK: synthesis

AÇIKLAMA:
The importance of hair in our lives cannot be overstated. Whether men or women lose their hair, they lose much more than their natural, youthful appearance. People also lose their self-esteem and self-confidence associated with healthy looking hair. Hair loss also, called alopecia, is a common problem affecting both men and women. Acetyl tetrapeptide-3 is an innovative and unique active complex designed to prevent, and stop the hair loss process and stimulate hair growth. It is a biomimetic peptide (acetyl tetrapeptide-3) combined with a red clover extract rich in Biochanin A. The efficacy is based on the combined and synergistic action of its two ingredients. Normal hair follicle is surrounded by healthy connective tissue and dermal papilla, and has minimal or absence of inflammation nor oxidative stress. Hair loss sufferers will most of the time have the hair growth cycle disrupted by an increase of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) hormone, loss of connective tissue integrity surrounding the hair follicle, and an increase of the inflammatory process and oxidative stress in the scalp. With age, the decrease number and size of hair follicles in the scalp will also lead to thinner hair and an increase in hair loss. Acetyl tetrapeptide-3 has a direct action on 5- -reductase which modulates dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to prevent hair miniaturization. It improves ECM proteins integrity in dermal papilla for a better hair anchoring. Acetyl tetrapeptide-3 also reduces damages caused by inflammation, providing maximal efficacy to reduce the hair loss process and stimulate hair growth. • Decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines with a synergistic action compared to red clover extract alone. • Biochanin A inhibits 5-α-reductase activity, thus confirming its effect on DHT production to reduce androgenic alopecia. • Acetyl tetrapeptide-3 stimulates collagen production for better ECM integrity leading to a better hair follicle anchoring. • Acetyl tetrapeptide-3 stimulates dermal papilla extracellular matrix proteins, and thus has a direct effect on hair follicle size and anchoring. • Acetyl tetrapeptide-3 stimulates hair growth with higher activity than the reference hair growth agent, Minoxidil®.

İÇERİK: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-5
KAYNAK: natural

AÇIKLAMA:
As skin loses its elasticity and muscles weaken through age, loose skin can accumulate around the eyes, forming eyebags. Water accumulation is another reason for puffy eyes, also known as eyelid oedema. This accumulation is due to several vascular deseases, such as a poor lymphatic circulation or an increased capillary permeability. This peptide fights against oedema-forming mechanisms and shows a decongesting effect, enhancing elasticity and skin smoothness. This peptide promotes the inhibition of glycation, which causes tissue damage, and reduces vascular permeability that can help minimize liquid-related eye puffiness. The ingredient is also efficient in decreasing lipid accumulation, suggesting a potential effect in minimizing eye bags caused by excess fat. Anti-dark circle effect is also achieved from the peptide due to its ability to degrade the colored bilirubin compound. • Prevents collagen cross-linking: Inhibition of collagen glycation avoids losing elasticity and subsequent eye bags formation. • Draining and anti-oedema effect prevents liquid accumulation in eye bags. • Decrease of dark circles under the eyes ITA and L* values significantly increased showing a slight lightening effect.

İÇERİK: Carcinine
KAYNAK: synthesis

AÇIKLAMA:
Carcinine is a nature-identical compound obtained from the decarboxylation of carnosine. Carcinine has demonstrated its ability to protect the skin integrity from oxidative stress (by detoxification, scavenging and damage repairing). Besides intrinsic aging, the skin is under the constant aggression of oxidative entities (solar radiations, pollution, physical stress, etc.). The resulting oxidative stress can affect the structure of the cutaneous tissue and the metabolic activity of its composing cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Since these factors are essential for the quality of the skin, It is a peptidic compound which is able to protect the skin components such as the collagen from these aggressions and to maintain the metabolic activities of the exposed cells. Treatment will both prevent and repair the daily aggressions-induced damages, allowing the skin to remain healthy, firm and beautiful. It acts in three different, non-exclusive, ways for a maximal efficiency: 1) Anti-oxidation / anti-stress 3) Metabolism stimulation For anti-glycation: protects the collagen and other proteins from the glycation processes at two different levels: • Prevention: by glucose scavenging. • Reparation: by substituting itself to the collagen in a transglycation process. Hence, it prevents the protein from cross-linking, while other anti-oxidants such as vitamin E fail at it. Even more potent than aminoguanidine, a reference in anti-glycation. Furthermore, the final products of the reaction are neither toxic nor mutagenic. The skin preserves its structure and A unique anti-oxidant: UV radiation can induce damage that can be monitored by measuring the cells redox status. The skin can slowly recover by itself from UV irradiation. However, even after 24h, the self healing process still was not complete. Treatment with carcinine led to a full recovery in just about 8h. It provides a fast and reliable protection against oxidative stress-induced damage as demonstrated. reduces the noxious LOOH (lipid peroxide) into harmless alcohol LOH, preventing the protein degradation into toxic free radicals as assessed by HPLC. This anti-oxidative effect is unique and is not shared by other anti-oxidants such as Vitamin E. Alistin’s anti-oxidative properties are also due to its scavenging power as shown by its ability to reduce MDA (a toxic by-product of oxidative stress) production. Reduces skin inflammation: Aggressions can lead to skin inflammation. When applied on human reconstituted epidermis, it reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IL-8. Hence, it has anti-inflammatory and soothing properties comparable to corticoids without the severe side effects. Energizes the skin: Sirtuins are proteins involved in aging, stress resistance and cell metabolism through their ability to maintain ATP levels. It stimulates the production of sirtuins in a dose dependant manner, hence enhancing skin cells metabolic abilities. Stimulates collagen production: With age, the collagen production is reduced, the firmness of the skin is reduced, wrinkles appear. It stimulates fibroblastic collagen production in a dose dependant manner. The skin is denser and younger. Improves hair density: By increasing the amount of hair in the anagen phase, a 6 month treatment, when coupled with organic silica, improves the hair density for 80% of tested alopecic men. The hair is denser, healthier.

İÇERİK: Hexapeptide-10
KAYNAK: synthesis

AÇIKLAMA:
The study of the mechanisms of skin aging has traditionally overlooked an important area: the dermo epidermal junction (DEJ). This is the layer responsible for supporting the epidermis and for the communication between epidermal and dermal cells. The DEJ is physically a basement membrane that separates the skin cells in the epidermis from the extracellular matrix (ECM) which lies below, in the dermis. This membrane is composed by two layers, the basal lamina, in contact with the cells, and the underlying reticular lamina, in contact with the ECM. The basal lamina is rich in collagen type IV, proteoglycans and the glycoproteins entactin and laminin. These molecules provide a structural network and bioadhesive properties for cell attachment. Laminin is a glycoprotein of about 850 kDa and it is, after collagen, the most abundant protein in the ECM. However, while Collagen performs exclusively a structural role in the skin, Laminin is involved in functionalisation and activation of cells, in processes such as cell proliferation, migration and adhesion. These mechanisms are necessary to keep the normal balance of the skin and are essential for processes as important as wound healing, for instance. Laminin only exists in basement membranes. It is composed of three very long polypeptide chains (alpha, beta and gamma) arranged in the shape of an assymetric cross and held together by disulfide bonds. The three chains exist as different subtypes which results in twelve different isoforms for laminin, of which the best well- studied is Laminin-1. Keratinocytes recognise the binding domains on Laminin, particularly Laminin-5, by using their own integrin receptors, transmembrane proteins located on specific junction points called hemidesmosomes. Lipotec has identified and synthesized a sequence from the alpha chain of Laminin: hexapeptide-10 . This peptide retains many of the chracteristics of the native protein, and promotes cell adhesion and proliferation Certain features of the DEJ are altered by the aging process, such as the anchoring ability of keratinocytes, probably due to deficiencies in the expression of integrins as we age. Laminin-5 synthesis has also been proved to decrease in aged skin. This causes a loss of contact between dermis and epidermis, and results in the skin losing elasticity and becoming saggy. The cohesion between dermis and epidermis is essential to maintain skin balance because it enables the transport of oxygen, nutrients and waste, contributing to the health of the epidermis. This work will show that a synthetic hexapeptide from Laminin-1 is able to restore the skin’s normal function by promoting synthesis of Laminin-5, stimulating keratinocyte and fibroblast proliferation, inducing a redensifying effect on the dermis, and an improvement in skin elasticity, compactness, tonicity and smoothness.

Magnesium plays a number of roles in the body, being required for more than 325 enzymatic reactions, including those involved in the synthesis of fat, protein and nucleic acids, neurological activity, muscular contraction and relaxation, cardiac activity and bone metabolism. Helps prevent calcium buildup on your scalp. When calcium clogs hair follicles, your scalp will be dry, flaky, and you could even see some hair loss. These calcium deposits on and around the hair follicles can increase over time due to scalp inflammation. Also magnesium helps with protein synthesis. Since hair follicles are made almost entirely of protein, this is key. Better protein synthesis means healthier hair and a predictable hair cycle with normal growing and resting stages. Protein synthesis also helps create melanin, which helps prevent your hair from going gray.

İÇERİK: Octapeptide
KAYNAK: synthesis

AÇIKLAMA:
Muscles beneath the skin precisely control movement of forehead, eyes, nose, lips and mouth in such a way that human face is capable of more than 10,000 different expressions. Facial expressions are vital as they are a means of communication and convey emotional states. Apart from having a role in social interaction, they influence perception of attractiveness. An expressive face is beautiful, as it transmits personality and emotions. But there is a downside, as facial expressions are linked with the formation of expression wrinkles (or mimic wrinkles). The most effective strategy to diminish the formation of expression wrinkles and their progression over time is to reduce excessive stimulation Molecules that can modulate neuronal exocytosis can contribute to relaxing muscular tension, and therefore they can be used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are naturally-occurring proteins that act through such mechanism of action. This kind of toxins cleaves the proteins that make up the SNARE complex, blocking neuronal exocytosis at the MNJ in an irreversible manner and paralyzing muscle contraction as a result. The injection of BoNTs to the skin avoids the formation of expression wrinkles, but this procedure is not exempt from adverse side effects including allergic reactions. In addition, due to muscle paralysis, side effects such as drooping eyelid or facial asymmetry and a loss of facial expressivity can occur. Besides, the anti-wrinkle effect lasts for a limited period of time, typically 3-4 months, requiring regular re-applications. Biomimetic competitive inhibitory peptides are developed to imitate proteins found in the skin and compete with them to modulate their The application of biomimetic peptides that compete with the skin components involved in neurotransmitter exocytosis can lessen the process of muscle contraction in a reversible and controlled manner, and thus it enables to reduce expression wrinkle formation. In addition, these small compounds can be topically applied and are not associated with adverse effects. Therefore, biomimetic inhibitory peptides are a safe alternative to BoNTs and they allow maintaining natural expressions of the face, so important to feel comfortable. Length of these competitive peptides is critical for their inhibitory activity. Longer peptides usually have a higher similarity with the native protein, which enhances their affinity and inhibitory capacity. Peptides showing high activity can be applied topically to delay the progression of expression lines into permanent wrinkles that are deeper and more visible, especially in middle-aged women This octapeptide is an elongation of the revolutionary ARGIRELINE® peptide. Because these peptides are patterned after the N-terminal domain of SNAP-25, they can bind to the SNARE complex causing its destabilization. As a result, vesicles cannot release neurotransmitters as efficiently in the NMJ, therefore muscle contraction can be attenuated. The topical application of octapeptide peptide could help to prevent the formation of lines and wrinkles caused by the repetitive contraction of muscles of facial expression with an alternate mechanism to botulinum toxin. This would apply to wrinkles that have already appeared by 30s or even before, but also to delay their progression through the 40-50s, helping to maintain a smoother skin in those areas prone to show deeper and more visible wrinkles. The in vitro efficacy tests of octapeptide peptide have proven that it inhibits the formation of the SNARE complex and that it can also modulate the release of neurotransmitter by neuron cells. Clinical test showed a visible decrease in wrinkle depth and skin roughness after the treatments application in areas with expression wrinkles.

İÇERİK: Organic silicium
KAYNAK: synthesis

AÇIKLAMA:
Silicium is an essential component of the skin. Indeed, by interacting with structure and elastic proteins within the dermis such as collagen fibers, elastin and proteoglycans, the silicium insures optimal skin organization and architecture. furthermore, many studies show that silicium is capable of stimulating skin cell metabolism for enhanced cell proliferation and activity (e. g. collagen production, contraction ability…). However, with age the amount of silicium naturally present in the skin tends to decrease. As a result, an overall collapse of the skin architecture will happen, which will in turn induce skin metabolism slow down, inevitably leading to wrinkles. With the silanol technology, we replenish the natural pool of silicium hence allowing a complete skin restructuration for global benefits at all • Within the epidermis, organic silicium or silica improves keratinocyte proliferation. Because of aging, keratinocytes have a lower proliferation rate that slowly leads to an epidermis thinning and eventually weakens skin protection and reduce skin hydration because of an increased transepidermis water loss. Organic silicium improves the number of proliferative keratinocytes in human reconstructed epidermis. That leads to a thickening of the epidermis for a skin that will be better protected and better hydrated. • Within the DEJ, organic silicium improves skin cohesion. The dermal epidermal junction (DEJ) is the interface between both skin compartments. It is responsible for skin cohesion. With age, the DEJ becomes thinner and can be duplicated, hence leading to a loss of cohesion and a decreased cell communication. Organic silicium is capable of improving collagen VII expression, one of the key constituent of the DEJ in human skin explants. This leads to an improved skin cohesion and skin cell communication. • Within the dermis, organic silicium improves collagen production. With age, all metabolisms tend to slow down. In the dermis this results in a lower proliferation rate and a lower activity of fibroblasts. There are too few collagen fibers and the skin is flaccid and wrinkled. Organic silicium stimulates fibroblast number and activity. In the dermis, there will be more fibroblasts and each one of them will produce more collagen. This strong collagen booster effect leads to a firmer and more elastic skin. Wrinkles are filled and erased. • Within the hypodermis, organic silicium improves lipolysis. With age, there are more and more adipocytes (fat storing cells). This causes a fat accumulation leading for example to cellulite on the body and eye bags on the face. Organic silicium stimulates adipocite ability to get rid of the fat by improving lipolysis. A treatment with organic silicium improves three folds the amount of fat released by adipocytes. cellulite is strongly reduced, skin is firmer and eye bags are reduced. Recognized as a separate entity within the skin, the hair follicle’s formation and maintenance is linked to the interaction between its dermal and epidermal components. It is in the hair follicles that are located the actively proliferating cells that generate hair. Both the hair quality and quantity depend on the significant presence of silicium in the dermis, epidermis and the hair shaft. Organic silicium demonstrated a significant improvement on hair growth and vitality in combination with carcinine. F-XBC, F-HAIR, F-HAIR MEN.

KAYNAK: synthesis

AÇIKLAMA:
Expression wrinkles are a particular type linked to repeated muscular contraction and they usually appear as soon as the age of 30. Muscles are contracted when they receive acetylcholine released from a vesicle in the neuronal exocytosis. In order to fuse a vesicle with the cellular membrane, two events are required: the SNARE complex formation and the entry of calcium ions into the neuron. Pentapetide is a modified enkephalin that couples to the enkephalin receptor, outside of nerve cells. This association releases G protein subunits (α,ß,Y), which close calcium channels avoiding vesicle fusion and consequently inhibiting acetylcholine release across the synapse. This process maintains the neuron in its resting state, attenuating muscle contraction and preventing the formation of lines and wrinkles.

KAYNAK: natural

AÇIKLAMA:
Pyruvic acid, a product of pyruvate, is a natural compound produced by the body that helps make and use energy. Because it is instrumental in the metabolism of fat, people sometimes take pyruvate supplements to lose weight. Although studies have indicated that it may be an effective weight-control supplement. Scientists believe pyruvate exerts a fat-loss effect in several possible ways: may increase the breakdown of fat in the body; may increase muscle mass. This has been observed in some research and could also account for pyruvate’s metabolic-stimulating effect, because muscle increases metabolism; prevents fat regain and helps you keep weight off; works as an antioxidant to fight free radicals and heal the tissue damage they cause; reverses the order in which body uses energy. Normally, the body draws on carbs first for energy, then protein, and finally fat. Remarkably, pyruvate appears to reverse that order to burn fat first for its energy needs. But why the reversal? Pyruvate may reduce insulin levels in the body. Insulin is a busy hormone. Among its duties is to promote fat storage. But if insulin levels are low, less fat is stored in fat cells – which could partially explain pyruvate’s effect on fat-burning.

COUPErIX• Chronic skin redness disorder with visible capillaries that can also turn the skin dull. • It typically affects individuals with pale skin and especially women over 30s. • Its etilogy is uncertain but several factors can induce it (strong emotions, spicy food, sport practise, alcohol,…). In the natural response of the immune system to potential harmful agents and conditions, kallikreins and antimicrobial compounds like cathelicidins have an important role. They induce the release of interleukines (IL), which are among the increased molecules in facial skin redness and vascular alterations. In skin disorders with erythema and dilated blood vessels, like rosacea, LL-37 expression is found to be abnormally high, it is locally activated and a cascade of inflammatory reactions leads to an increase of pro-inflammatory metabolites, IL-6 and IL-8 among others.The dermal connective tissue may be damaged as the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), mainly of collagen, is increased due to Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) activation. Therefore, red areas become more visible as capillaries are fragile and permeable, and blood vessels can easily dilate due to inflammation. Tetrapeptide peptide helps to decrease facial redness and other skin disorders caused by LL-37 activation and subsequent release of ILs. It also provides a photoprotective effect lowering cell damage and skin inflammation negative • Lowers LL-37-mediated IL-6 and IL-8 release: IL-6 levels decreased by 24.2% and IL-8, by 22.8% with Tetrapeptides at 0.5mg/ml. • Connective tissue degradation is reduced by Tetrapeptides that demonstrated a statistically significant inhibitory effect on collagenase • Erythema, redness and extent intensity are reduced by Tetrapeptides. • Skin roughness diminished as well, by 7.5% at the end of the treatment.

Hormonal acne comes in many shapes and forms. Some people have legitimate conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), some have hyperandrogenism, and then there are the people like me who get every hormonal test in the book and they all come back stellar. They’re just unfortunate enough to have an increased sensitivity to male hormones like testosterone, especially on the “hormonal” areas of the face. There are still new ways that are surfacing that people may be interested in trying before resorting to things like birth control or isotretinoin. Overconsumption of B vitamins at over 250 mg a day can lead to more acne, but some studies show B6 at 50-250 mg a day reduce sebum production and reduce the effects of testosterone. Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, like any vitamin, is needed for a wide range of bodily functions like cellular metabolism, energy production, red blood cell development, etc. Not only that, but vitamin B6 actually promotes healthy skin, by reducing its sensitivity to testosterone, as well as by participating in the synthesis of RNA and DNA, which contain the instructions for repair and growth of the epidermis which is affected by acne. The positive effects of vitamin B6 in acne treatment are generally attributed to the role of the vitamin in regulating hormone activity and prostaglandin action. Vitamin B6 can reduce the effects of testosterone and its metabolites such as dihydrotestosterone. By regulating these male sex hormones, vitamin B6 prevents the hormonal imbalance that causes acne.
