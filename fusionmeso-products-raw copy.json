This remarkable ingredient works Diligently to restore vitality to the delicate under-eye region.\r\n– Hyaluronic acid in high concentration, a moisture-retaining marvel. This ingredient hydrates and plump the skin, leaving it rejuvenated, effectively reducing fine lines and wrinkles for a more youthful appearance.\r\n– Fibroblast growth factor further enhances our formulation’s potency. It plays a pivotal role in stimulating collagen production, thereby addressing fine lines and wrinkles to promote firmer and smoother skin.\r\n\r\nSeveral anatomical factors, including excess orbital fat, especially in men, contribute to the aesthetic concern of under-eye bags. The lower eyelid comprises three fat compartments that progressively protrude with age, resulting in visible eye bags. Concurrently, weakened skin that supports these compartments and elevated fluid buildup, fueled by heightened capillary permeability, may exacerbate under-eye puffiness.\r\n\r\nThe persistence of under-eye darkness is primarily attributed to colored compounds stemming from blood permeation, such as bilirubin. These compounds become more conspicuous due to the increased skin transparency caused by tissue deterioration.\r\nClinically proven active ingredients fortify our formulation, delivering exceptional results to the eye contours’ delicate area and targeting dark circles.\r\n\r\nContact us for official distributors informations.",

This product is formulated for use on very localized facial areas, targeting specific areas of concern. The key component of this formula is tranexamic acid, which plays a crucial role in reducing pigmentation and achieving a more even skin tone.\r\n\r\nTranexamic acid works in the skin by inhibiting UV-induced plasmin activity in keratinocytes. It does so by preventing the binding of plasminogen to keratinocytes, leading to a reduction in melanocyte tyrosinase activity. This inhibition ultimately contributes to the lightening of dark spots and pigmentation. Importantly, tranexamic acid is suitable for all skin types.\r\n\r\nTo enhance the effectiveness of tranexamic acid, F-MELACLEAR combines it with other safe and effective skin lightening ingredients, including resorcinol, glutathione, niacinamide, and arbutin. These ingredients work together to further reduce pigmentation, whiten the skin, and minimize the appearance of spots.\r\n\r\nFor optimal and long-lasting results, it is recommended to use F-MELACLEAR in conjunction with Meso-shield 50, which provides protection from UV damage and helps maintain the achieved skin improvements.\r\n\r\nContact us for official distributors informations.",
